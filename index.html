    <h1>Summer 2013</h1>
    <p>Last summer wasn't all that fun... :( That's because I didn't have a list of things that I wanted to complete during my time off. Then I found DIY.org and things changed! I came up with a plan for this summer: To complete as many skills as I really wanted trying to gain real-life skills that I could show off to other people. The link to my DIY page is <a href="https://diy.org/CrowRed" alt="Crow Red">here</a>. Check it out to see all of the neat things that I have been up to this summer! I've already got a head start!</p>
    <p>P.S. Just a fun little fact: I like to design websites all the time! This one is probably my 10th (or something...I lost track a long while ago)! But I can always use the practice!</p>
